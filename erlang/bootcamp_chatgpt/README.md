Intro
-----

Georgiana discusses the use of ChatGPT as a tool for learning and teaching Erlang. She shares her passion for functional programming and the evolution of learning from oral tradition to the internet and now to ChatGPT. ChatGPT, a natural language processing tool developed by OpenAI, allows for dynamic conversations and summarizes results. Georgiana demonstrates this by asking ChatGPT to explain Erlang concepts and creating a study plan. She also discusses using ChatGPT to review code, refactor functions, and create Erlang projects. However, she emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on ChatGPT and encourages learners to challenge its output and write their own code. Georgiana also explores the potential use of ChatGPT as a tool for trainers to create curriculums and assist in teaching Erlang.

Georgiana has been an Erlang enthusiast for 7 years and many more to come. She takes pleasure in sharing her knowledge and gives back to the community by presenting Erlang insights at meetups.

In this fast-moving tech universe, Georgiana is always chasing the newest tools and trends in functional programming. She's not just building the future; she's creating it, one Erlang line at a time.
She'll be giving a talk about learning Erlang with ChatGPT, so you can expect some insights about how to use it as a coach and the boundaries you need to be aware of.
